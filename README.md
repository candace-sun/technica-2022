## Inspiration
We wanted to create something that would be simple but useful, and we decided to focus on introducing computer science to younger (middle-high school) students because we thought it would be a great way to connect with potentially interested students in an engaging way and provide them with the information they need.

## What it does
Students take a "personality" quiz that will determine which coding language would best fit their interests. Then, they are informed on the language they received and introduced to the other languages, they could be interested in. 

## How we built it
Our website was built using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. Each team member focused on a significant part of the website, and we brought it all together in the end.

## Challenges we ran into
Some of our members were not familiar with coding in HTML, Javascript, and CSS, so having to learn the language from scratch was a challenge itself for some of us. We also used different programs to create this website as well as worked on different parts, so combining our code so that it all flows how we intended in the end, was also a bit challenging.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We were able to work together to create a platform that could benefit students and inspire future coders.

## What we learned
We learned how to create an interactive website that comes to a single solution based on the answers given to it by the user. We also learned more about the different coding languages and their benefits and cons. 

## What's next for Find Your Language
Next, the direction we would go in is adding more choices based on the userâ€™s age, experience, and preferences. We would also be adding more information and resources catered towards each user. Also maybe a "Contact Us" page like common websites have and more resources on the website.
